# Introduction
Developed a machine learning model with the goal of predicting long-term rainfall patterns in Narendra Nagar, a small town located in the Uttarakhand Tehri district. 

The project included:
- Preprocessing large volumes of data obtained from IMD (Indian Meteorological Department) to extract relevant features that could serve as input parameters for training the ML model. 
- Conducting a comprehensive evaluation of various machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, BPNN (Backpropagation Neural Network), SVR (Support Vector Regression), and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) with the aim to identify the most suitable predictive model that would yield accurate forecasts. 

The developed model demonstrated high accuracy in forecasting long-term rainfall patterns, making it a viable sub-module for building an effective landslide prediction system.
